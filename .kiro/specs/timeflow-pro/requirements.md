# Requirements Document

## Introduction

TimeFlow Pro is an advanced web-based time tracking and billing management system designed for freelancers, consultants, and project-based professionals. The system addresses a critical gap in the market by providing granular control over time tracking versus billing flexibility, recognizing that actual work performed often differs from billable hours due to learning curves, rework, or competitive pricing strategies.

The application operates as a client-side-only web application with offline-first architecture, integrating seamlessly with Asana for project management and JSONBin.io for cloud storage. This approach eliminates server infrastructure costs while providing professional-grade features including real-time timer functionality, flexible billing rates, three-stage payment tracking, and comprehensive analytics.
