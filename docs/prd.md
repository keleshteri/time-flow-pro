# TimeFlow Pro Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Provide freelancers and consultants with accurate, flexible time tracking that separates actual hours from billable hours
• Enable seamless integration with existing project management workflows (starting with Asana)
• Create professional billing management with multi-stage payment tracking (Ready to Bill → Billed → Paid)
• Deliver comprehensive analytics and reporting for productivity insights and revenue tracking
• Establish reliable cloud-based data synchronization with offline capabilities

### Background Context
TimeFlow Pro addresses a critical gap in the freelance/consulting market where professionals need granular control over time tracking versus billing flexibility. Current solutions force users to choose between accurate time tracking or billing convenience, but not both. This system recognizes that actual work performed (10 hours) often differs from billable hours (4 hours) due to learning curves, rework, or competitive pricing strategies.

The target market of freelance developers, consultants, and project-based professionals increasingly rely on tools like Asana for project management but lack integrated time tracking solutions that maintain billing flexibility while providing professional-grade reporting and payment tracking.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Clean, professional interface optimized for productivity and quick time entry. Focus on minimal clicks to start/stop timers and enter time data. Dashboard-centric design that surfaces key metrics (active timers, daily summaries, outstanding payments) without overwhelming the user.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **One-click timer control** - prominent start/stop buttons with visual feedback
- **Contextual time entry** - smart defaults based on current project and recent activities
- **Progressive disclosure** - basic timer interface expands to show detailed project/task selection when needed
- **Real-time feedback** - live updates of running timers, sync status, and calculation changes

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Dashboard** - Active timers, today's summary, quick project access
- **Time Entry Form** - Manual time logging with project/task selection
- **Project Management** - Task creation, progress tracking, Asana sync status
- **Billing Dashboard** - Ready to bill, billed, paid status with revenue summaries
- **Reports & Analytics** - Weekly breakdowns, productivity insights, export functions
- **Settings Page** - Asana integration, billing rates, sync preferences

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Keyboard navigation support, proper ARIA labels, color contrast compliance, and screen reader compatibility for professional accessibility standards.

### Branding
Clean, modern professional aesthetic suitable for freelance/consulting market. Emphasis on clarity and efficiency over flashy design. Color scheme should differentiate timer states (running/stopped) and billing stages clearly.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Optimized for desktop productivity workflows but fully responsive for mobile time entry and quick status checks.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing the complete TimeFlow Pro web application with clear folder structure for components, services, and utilities.

### Service Architecture
**Monolith** - Single-page web application with modular architecture. All functionality contained within one deployable unit for MVP simplicity, with clear separation between:
- Timer/Time Entry modules
- Task Management modules  
- Billing/Payment modules
- Integration modules (Asana, Cloud Storage)
- Analytics/Reporting modules

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration** - Comprehensive testing strategy including:
- Unit tests for core business logic (time calculations, billing logic)
- Integration tests for external APIs (Asana, JSONBin.io)
- Manual testing convenience methods for UI workflows
- Local storage and sync operation testing

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Technology Stack:**
- **HTML5/CSS3/Vanilla JavaScript** for maximum performance and minimal dependencies
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox** for responsive layout without framework overhead
- **LocalStorage API** for offline capability and data persistence
- **Fetch API** for all external integrations

**External Service Dependencies:**
- **Asana REST API v1.0** with Personal Access Token authentication
- **JSONBin.io API** as primary cloud storage (free tier sufficient for MVP)
- **Rate limiting compliance** - 150 requests/minute for Asana API
- **Offline-first architecture** - full functionality without network connectivity

**Browser Compatibility:**
- **Minimum support:** Chrome 70+, Firefox 65+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+
- **Progressive enhancement** approach for older browsers
- **ES6+ JavaScript** with appropriate polyfills if needed

**Performance Constraints:**
- **10MB maximum** localStorage usage
- **Sub-3-second** page load times on 3G connections
- **Client-side only** - no server infrastructure required for MVP

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
"Review the TimeFlow Pro PRD focusing on the UI Design Goals section. Create comprehensive interface mockups and user flow designs for the dashboard-centric time tracking interface, emphasizing one-click timer controls, real-time feedback, and professional billing management workflows. Ensure the design supports the unique billable vs. tracked hours functionality and integrates seamlessly with Asana synchronization features."

### Architect Prompt
"Using the TimeFlow Pro PRD as foundation, design the technical architecture for a vanilla JavaScript web application with JSONBin.io cloud storage and Asana API integration. Focus on client-side data encryption, offline-first architecture with robust sync conflict resolution, and scalable data structures supporting complex time-billing relationships. Address the identified technical risks around API rate limiting, localStorage capacity, and cross-device synchronization."
