# Building TimeFlow Pro - Task 1.2: Core Component Library & Design System

## Context
I'm building the foundational UI components for TimeFlow Pro. I need to create a comprehensive component library with design system integration following our established architecture.

## Reference Files
[Attach: tasks.md, design.md, technical-assumptions.md]

## Specific Task (from tasks.md)
Story 1.2: Core Component Library & Design System
- Create base UI components (Button, Input, Modal, Card) with variants and accessibility
- Integrate TailwindCSS design system with custom tokens
- Set up Storybook documentation with interactive examples
- Implement comprehensive component testing

## What I Need You to Create:

### 1. Base UI Components:
- `src/lib/components/ui/Button.svelte` with variants (primary, secondary, danger, ghost) and sizes (sm, md, lg)
- `src/lib/components/ui/Input.svelte` with validation states, icons, and accessibility
- `src/lib/components/ui/Modal.svelte` with focus management and keyboard navigation
- `src/lib/components/ui/Card.svelte` with consistent spacing and elevation

### 2. Design System Configuration:
- Enhanced `tailwind.config.js` with custom TimeFlow Pro color palette
- CSS custom properties for design tokens (spacing, colors, shadows)
- Dark mode configuration with system preference detection
- High contrast themes for accessibility

### 3. TypeScript Interfaces:
- `src/lib/types/components.ts` with comprehensive prop definitions
- Button variants and size type definitions
- Input validation state types
- Modal and Card prop interfaces

### 4. Storybook Stories:
- `src/stories/Button.stories.ts` with all variants and interactive controls
- `src/stories/Input.stories.ts` with validation states and accessibility examples
- `src/stories/Modal.stories.ts` with different content types
- `src/stories/Card.stories.ts` with various layouts

### 5. Component Tests:
- `src/lib/components/ui/Button.test.ts` with Vitest and Testing Library
- Component interaction tests for all variants
- Accessibility tests with axe-core
- Keyboard navigation tests

## Requirements:
- Follow component patterns from design.md
- Use TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive interfaces
- Implement WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Add proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Include responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Use consistent spacing and typography from design system
- Add smooth transitions and hover states
- Include comprehensive JSDoc comments

## Expected Output:
1. Four fully functional UI components with TypeScript support
2. Complete Storybook documentation with interactive examples
3. Comprehensive test suite with 95%+ coverage
4. Design system tokens properly configured in TailwindCSS
5. Dark mode support working across all components
6. Accessibility features tested and validated

## Success Criteria:
- `npm run storybook` shows all components with interactive controls
- `npm run test` passes all component tests with coverage reports
- Components work identically in light and dark modes
- All components pass accessibility validation
- TypeScript compilation with zero errors
- Components are responsive and work on mobile devices

## Usage Example Expected:
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Button, Input, Modal, Card } from '$lib/components/ui';
</script>

<Card>
  <Input 
    label="Project Name" 
    placeholder="Enter project name..."
    required
  />
  <Button variant="primary" size="lg">
    Create Project
  </Button>
</Card>
```
