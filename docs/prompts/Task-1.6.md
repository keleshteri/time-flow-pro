# Building TimeFlow Pro - Task 1.6: Offline-First Architecture Implementation

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: READ THESE FIRST
**Before writing any code, you MUST:**
1. **Read CHANGELOG.md** - Review all previous foundation work and current state
2. **Read and follow AI-RULES.md** - All development rules and standards
3. **Use exact versions from TECH-STACK.md** - Never downgrade packages
4. **Research current documentation** - PWA, service worker, and IndexedDB best practices

## Context
I'm implementing the offline-first architecture for TimeFlow Pro. This is the capstone of the foundation phase, enabling full application functionality without internet connectivity and creating a robust PWA experience.

## Reference Files
**REQUIRED FILES TO ATTACH:**
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` (Critical - complete foundation context)
- [ ] `AI-RULES.md` (Critical - forbidden practices and standards)
- [ ] `TECH-STACK.md` (Critical - exact versions to use)
- [ ] `tasks.md` (Specific task requirements)
- [ ] `design.md` (Architecture and patterns)
- [ ] `technical-assumptions.md` (Storage and sync strategies)

## Previous Work Dependencies
**This task completes the foundation by building on:**
- Task 1.1: SvelteKit foundation with PWA configuration
- Task 1.2: UI component library for offline indicators
- Task 1.3: Timer engine with localStorage persistence
- Task 1.4: Time entry forms with data validation
- Task 1.5: Project management with complex data relationships

## Specific Task (from tasks.md)
Story 1.6: Offline-First Architecture Implementation
- Configure SvelteKit service worker with intelligent caching strategies
- Implement multi-tier storage (localStorage, IndexedDB, cloud sync preparation)
- Create offline data management with conflict resolution
- Build user experience for offline/online transitions

## What I Need You to Create:

### 1. Service Worker Configuration (`src/service-worker.ts`):
**Advanced PWA Service Worker:**
- Cache-first strategy for app shell and static assets
- Network-first strategy for API calls with offline fallback
- Background sync for offline operations
- Intelligent cache management and cleanup
- Version management for cache updates

### 2. Storage Architecture (`src/lib/services/storage/`):
**`storage-service.ts` - Multi-tier Storage Manager:**
```typescript
interface StorageService {
  // Hot data (localStorage - immediate access)
  saveHotData(key: string, data: any): Promise<void>;
  getHotData(key: string): Promise<any>;
  
  // Warm data (IndexedDB - larger capacity)
  saveWarmData(key: string, data: any): Promise<void>;
  getWarmData(key: string): Promise<any>;
  
  // Storage tier management
  migrateToWarmStorage(key: string): Promise<void>;
  getStorageUsage(): Promise<StorageUsage>;
  cleanupOldData(): Promise<void>;
}

interface StorageUsage {
  localStorage: { used: number; limit: number; percentage: number };
  indexedDB: { used: number; estimated: number };
  total: { used: number; available: number };
}
```

**`indexeddb-service.ts` - IndexedDB Management:**
- Database schema for projects, tasks, time entries
- Transaction management and error handling
- Data migration and versioning
- Bulk operations for large datasets
- Search and indexing capabilities

### 3. Offline Queue System (`src/lib/services/offline/`):
**`offline-queue.ts` - Sync Queue Manager:**
```typescript
interface QueuedOperation {
  id: string;
  type: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete';
  entity: 'project' | 'task' | 'timeEntry';
  data: any;
  timestamp: Date;
  retries: number;
  priority: 'high' | 'normal' | 'low';
}

interface OfflineQueue {
  enqueue(operation: QueuedOperation): void;
  processQueue(): Promise<void>;
  getQueueStatus(): QueueStatus;
  retryFailed(): Promise<void>;
}
```

**`conflict-resolver.ts` - Data Conflict Resolution:**
- Three-way merge algorithms for simultaneous edits
- Timestamp-based conflict detection
- User-prompted resolution for complex conflicts
- Automatic resolution for simple cases

### 4. Network Status Management (`src/lib/stores/network.ts`):
**Reactive Network State:**
```typescript
interface NetworkState {
  isOnline: boolean;
  wasOffline: boolean;
  lastOnline: Date | null;
  syncStatus: 'idle' | 'syncing' | 'error' | 'conflict';
  queuedOperations: number;
}
```

### 5. Offline UI Components (`src/lib/components/offline/`):
**`OfflineIndicator.svelte`:**
- Network status display with visual feedback
- Sync progress indicators
- Queue status and operation count
- User-friendly offline messaging

**`SyncStatus.svelte`:**
- Detailed sync status with progress bars
- Conflict resolution interface
- Manual sync triggers
- Sync history and logs

**`StorageMonitor.svelte`:**
- Storage usage visualization
- Data cleanup recommendations
- Storage tier management interface
- Performance metrics display

### 6. PWA Enhancements (`static/`):
**Enhanced `manifest.json`:**
- Complete PWA manifest with all required fields
- App icons for all sizes and platforms
- Display modes and orientation preferences
- Theme colors and background colors

**`sw.js` - Service Worker Registration:**
- Proper service worker registration with update handling
- Cache versioning and cleanup
- Background sync registration
- Push notification preparation (for future features)

### 7. Data Migration System (`src/lib/services/migration/`):
**`data-migration.ts`:**
- Automatic data migration between storage tiers
- Age-based migration policies
- Usage-based migration strategies
- Data archiving and cleanup

## Requirements:
- Implement 100% feature parity in offline mode
- Intelligent caching with minimal storage usage
- Graceful degradation when storage limits reached
- User-friendly offline/online transition feedback
- Conflict resolution with user control when needed
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Security considerations for stored data
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Expected Output:
1. Complete service worker with intelligent caching strategies
2. Multi-tier storage system with automatic data management
3. Offline queue system with conflict resolution
4. Network status management with reactive UI updates
5. PWA enhancements for native app experience
6. Comprehensive offline UI components
7. Data migration and cleanup automation
8. Integration with all existing foundation components

## Success Criteria:
- Application works identically online and offline
- Data syncs correctly when connection restored
- Storage usage optimized with intelligent tier management
- User experience remains smooth during network transitions
- Conflicts resolved gracefully with user guidance when needed
- PWA passes all Lighthouse PWA criteria
- Performance maintained with large offline datasets
- All existing features continue working offline

## Integration Requirements:
- **With Timer System:** Timer works offline with full persistence
- **With Time Entries:** Forms work offline with queue sync
- **With Projects/Tasks:** Full CRUD operations available offline
- **With UI Components:** Offline indicators integrate seamlessly
- **With Storage:** Transparent multi-tier data management

## PWA Requirements:
- **Installable:** Meets all PWA installation criteria
- **Offline Capable:** Full functionality without network
- **App-like:** Native app experience and performance
- **Secure:** HTTPS-only with proper security headers
- **Responsive:** Works on all device sizes and orientations

## Usage Example Expected:
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { OfflineIndicator, SyncStatus } from '$lib/components/offline';
  import { networkState, offlineQueue } from '$lib/stores';
  import { TimerWidget } from '$lib/components/timer';
</script>

<!-- Always visible offline indicator -->
<OfflineIndicator {$networkState} />

<!-- Timer works identically offline -->
<TimerWidget 
  projectId="offline-project"
  on:started={() => /* works offline */}
  on:stopped={() => /* queued for sync */}
/>

<!-- Sync status when needed -->
{#if $networkState.queuedOperations > 0}
  <SyncStatus 
    queuedCount={$networkState.queuedOperations}
    on:manualSync={() => offlineQueue.processQueue()}
  />
{/if}
```

## Testing Requirements:
- **Offline Testing:** Complete functionality without network
