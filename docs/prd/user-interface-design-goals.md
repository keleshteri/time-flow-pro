# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Clean, professional interface optimized for productivity and quick time entry. Focus on minimal clicks to start/stop timers and enter time data. Dashboard-centric design that surfaces key metrics (active timers, daily summaries, outstanding payments) without overwhelming the user.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **One-click timer control** - prominent start/stop buttons with visual feedback
- **Contextual time entry** - smart defaults based on current project and recent activities
- **Progressive disclosure** - basic timer interface expands to show detailed project/task selection when needed
- **Real-time feedback** - live updates of running timers, sync status, and calculation changes

## Core Screens and Views
- **Main Dashboard** - Active timers, today's summary, quick project access
- **Time Entry Form** - Manual time logging with project/task selection
- **Project Management** - Task creation, progress tracking, Asana sync status
- **Billing Dashboard** - Ready to bill, billed, paid status with revenue summaries
- **Reports & Analytics** - Weekly breakdowns, productivity insights, export functions
- **Settings Page** - Asana integration, billing rates, sync preferences

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Keyboard navigation support, proper ARIA labels, color contrast compliance, and screen reader compatibility for professional accessibility standards.

## Branding
Clean, modern professional aesthetic suitable for freelance/consulting market. Emphasis on clarity and efficiency over flashy design. Color scheme should differentiate timer states (running/stopped) and billing stages clearly.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Optimized for desktop productivity workflows but fully responsive for mobile time entry and quick status checks.
