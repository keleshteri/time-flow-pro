# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
• Provide freelancers and consultants with accurate, flexible time tracking that separates actual hours from billable hours
• Enable seamless integration with existing project management workflows (starting with Asana)
• Create professional billing management with multi-stage payment tracking (Ready to Bill → Billed → Paid)
• Deliver comprehensive analytics and reporting for productivity insights and revenue tracking
• Establish reliable cloud-based data synchronization with offline capabilities

## Background Context
TimeFlow Pro addresses a critical gap in the freelance/consulting market where professionals need granular control over time tracking versus billing flexibility. Current solutions force users to choose between accurate time tracking or billing convenience, but not both. This system recognizes that actual work performed (10 hours) often differs from billable hours (4 hours) due to learning curves, rework, or competitive pricing strategies.

The target market of freelance developers, consultants, and project-based professionals increasingly rely on tools like Asana for project management but lack integrated time tracking solutions that maintain billing flexibility while providing professional-grade reporting and payment tracking.
