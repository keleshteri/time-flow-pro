## Data Architecture - Multi-Tier Storage Strategy

### Storage Tier Strategy

**localStorage → IndexedDB → Cloud** - Intelligent data placement for optimal performance:

#### Hot Data (localStorage - 10MB limit)

- Current month time entries and active projects
- User preferences and application state
- Timer session data and recent activity
- Cached API responses and temporary data

#### Warm Data (IndexedDB - ~1GB capacity)

- Historical time entries (3-12 months)
- Project archives and completed tasks
- Offline queue for sync operations
- Large datasets and computed analytics

#### Cold Data (Cloud Storage)

- Historical data beyond 12 months
- Encrypted backups and disaster recovery
- Cross-device synchronization data
- Audit logs and compliance records

### Synchronization Architecture

- **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**: Automatic conflict resolution
- **Event Sourcing**: Immutable event log for audit trails and rollback
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with background sync
- **Intelligent Sync**: Adaptive sync frequency based on activity patterns

## Security & Privacy Architecture

### Zero-Knowledge Client-Side Model

**Complete Data Ownership** - User data never stored on our servers:

#### Encryption Strategy

- **AES-256 Encryption**: All data encrypted before cloud storage
- **Web Crypto API**: Browser-native cryptographic operations
- **Client-Side Keys**: Encryption keys derived from user credentials
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Key rotation with backward compatibility

#### Privacy Controls

- **GDPR Compliance**: Right to portability and deletion by design
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect data essential for functionality
- **Consent Management**: Granular privacy controls and opt-out mechanisms
- **Audit Transparency**: Complete data access logging for user review

## Performance Requirements - Sub-Second Excellence
