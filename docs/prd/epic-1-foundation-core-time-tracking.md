# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Time Tracking

**Epic Goal:** Establish project infrastructure with Git, CI/CD, and core services while delivering immediately usable time tracking functionality. Users can start/stop timers, manually enter time, and persist data locally for basic freelance time tracking needs.

## Story 1.1: Project Foundation & Basic HTML Structure
As a developer,
I want to establish the project foundation with proper Git setup and basic HTML structure,
so that I can build upon a solid, deployable foundation while delivering a functional landing page.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore for web projects
2. Basic HTML5 structure with semantic elements and meta tags
3. CSS reset/normalize and basic styling framework established
4. JavaScript module structure with main app initialization
5. Local development server configuration (live-server or similar)
6. Basic responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
7. Placeholder content showing "TimeFlow Pro" branding
8. All code follows established naming conventions and structure

## Story 1.2: Real-Time Timer Functionality
As a freelancer,
I want to start and stop a timer with accurate time tracking,
so that I can capture precise work hours without manual calculation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Prominent Start/Stop timer button with clear visual states
2. Timer displays current elapsed time in HH:MM:SS format
3. Timer continues running across browser refresh (localStorage persistence)
4. Timer accuracy maintained to the second over extended periods
5. Visual indicators show timer status (running/stopped) clearly
6. Click interactions provide immediate feedback
7. Timer state persists when switching browser tabs
8. Current session time displays prominently on screen

## Story 1.3: Manual Time Entry System
As a freelancer,
I want to manually enter time periods for work completed offline,
so that I can maintain complete records even when I forgot to use the timer.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Date picker for selecting work date (defaults to today)
2. Start and end time inputs with validation
3. Automatic duration calculation shown in real-time
4. Basic description field for time entry notes
5. Save button creates persistent time entry record
6. Form validation prevents invalid time ranges (end before start, future dates)
7. Duration calculation handles overnight work correctly
8. Clear form reset after successful save

## Story 1.4: Time Entry Storage & Display
As a freelancer,
I want to view all my time entries in an organized list,
so that I can review my work history and verify accuracy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Time entries displayed in reverse chronological order (newest first)
2. Each entry shows date, duration, description, and timestamp
3. Total hours for current day prominently displayed
4. Edit functionality for existing time entries
5. Delete functionality with confirmation prompt
6. Data persisted in localStorage with proper error handling
7. Empty state message when no entries exist
8. Basic search/filter by date range
9. Running total calculations update in real-time

## Story 1.5: Local Data Management & Persistence
As a user,
I want my time tracking data to be reliably saved and retrieved,
so that I never lose work history due to browser issues or crashes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. All timer and entry data stored in localStorage with versioning
2. Data structure designed for future cloud sync compatibility
3. Automatic data backup every 5 minutes during active use
4. Recovery mechanism for corrupted localStorage data
5. Export functionality to download data as JSON backup
6. Import functionality to restore from JSON backup
7. Data migration capability for future schema changes
8. Maximum storage usage monitoring with warnings at 8MB
9. Graceful handling of localStorage quota exceeded errors
