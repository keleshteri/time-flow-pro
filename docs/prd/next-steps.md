# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
"Review the TimeFlow Pro PRD focusing on the UI Design Goals section. Create comprehensive interface mockups and user flow designs for the dashboard-centric time tracking interface, emphasizing one-click timer controls, real-time feedback, and professional billing management workflows. Ensure the design supports the unique billable vs. tracked hours functionality and integrates seamlessly with Asana synchronization features."

## Architect Prompt
"Using the TimeFlow Pro PRD as foundation, design the technical architecture for a vanilla JavaScript web application with JSONBin.io cloud storage and Asana API integration. Focus on client-side data encryption, offline-first architecture with robust sync conflict resolution, and scalable data structures supporting complex time-billing relationships. Address the identified technical risks around API rate limiting, localStorage capacity, and cross-device synchronization."
